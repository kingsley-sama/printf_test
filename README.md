# Custom Printf: Reimagining the Beloved C Standard Output Function

## Project Overview

The **Custom Printf** project is an ambitious endeavor to recreate the functionality of the iconic `printf` function in C. This project is designed for those seeking a deeper understanding of C programming, string formatting, and the intricacies of handling variable arguments.

## Features

- **Format Specifiers:** Implement a variety of format specifiers such as `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, `%f`, and more.
  
- **Width and Precision:** Extend the functionality to support width and precision modifiers to control the presentation of output.

- **Modifiers and Flags:** Explore the implementation of flags and modifiers like `0`, `-`, `+`, and space.

- **Variable Argument Handling:** Delve into the world of variable argument lists using `va_list`, `va_start`, `va_arg`, and `va_end`.

- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors and edge cases, providing informative messages to users.
